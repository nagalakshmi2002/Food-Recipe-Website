                    <p>Food Fusion is here to help you cook delicious meals,
                        with less stress and more joy. 
                        We offer recipes and cooking advice for home cooks, by home cooks. 
                        Helping create “kitchen wins” is what we’re all about.</p>
                    <p>At Food Fusion, we're passionate about the art of cooking and the joy it brings to people's lives. We believe that food has the incredible power to unite us, bringing together diverse flavors, cultures, and traditions.

                    <h2 id="r&d">Recipe Development & Testing</h2>
                    <p>There are three things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on Food Fusion:</p>
                        <p><b>First, does it work?</b>Recipes need to be easy to follow and provide reliable results, every time.</p>
                        <p><b>Second, is it delicious? </b>Does the dish make us smile inside and out? Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves?</p>
                        <p><b>Third, is it worth the effort? </b>Do we want to make it again (and again and again)?</p>
                        <p>To make sure each of these standards is met, we start by working with expert recipe developers called "Amma" in our homes— people with the experience and knowledge to not only develop
                             a good recipe in their own kitchens, but to make sure that recipe works in yours. Next, we thoroughly review and edit every recipe in-house line by line. 
                            Finally, each new recipe is run by our team of recipe testers working in home kitchens with the same pots, pans, and tools that you use in yours.
                             Only after all this is the recipe shared on Food Fusion.</p>
